Day1

You are brave.
Your life was not easy.
In fact, no one gets to live an easy life, no matter how flawless it seems from the outside
You are not an exception
This means that you are standing here today, because you've made it through those challenging times
You've been a victim, a survivor, and a hero.
You didn't run away or give up on your life.
You stayed alive and showed up.
Now you are standing in the arena that you chose to be in, going all in, giving it all you've got.
You are already brave.
You are already a hero.
That's who you are.

Day2

Let's reframe fear.
When was the last time you stopped yourself from doing something bacause you were afraid?
Let's be honest.
We all have the fear of not being good enough, so sometimes we don't even bother to try.
But what if you just choose to believe you are good enough?
And What if fear means you are heading towards the right direction?
The sensation you feel in your body is probadly telling you that you are stepping up your game.
The reason why you are scared is because you were brave enough to put yourself out there.
AS long as you are doing what's best for you, fear will always be there.
So instead, let's say. "Come on fear. You are coming along."
