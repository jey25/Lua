Day1

You are brave.
Your life was not easy.
In fact, no one gets to live an easy life, no matter how flawless it seems from the outside
You are not an exception
This means that you are standing here today, because you've made it through those challenging times
You've been a victim, a survivor, and a hero.
You didn't run away or give up on your life.
You stayed alive and showed up.
Now you are standing in the arena that you chose to be in, going all in, giving it all you've got.
You are already brave.
You are already a hero.
That's who you are.
